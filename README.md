# Keyboard Nav
This extensions strives to organize the text navigation shortcuts in VS Code into a more complete and memorable system.

Many of the shortcuts provided by this extension are the same as the default keybindings; however, a few important shortcuts have been moved, and a few new commands created to make everything more uniform.

- (⌘ + direction) will move the cursor maximally
- (⌥ + direction) will move the cursor by whitespace
- (^ + direction) will move the content under the cursor

The number of lines that the Cursor will move Up/Down with a (^ ⌥) keybinding is configurable in settings.
